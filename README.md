# jasperruner

Running jasper reports from a command line program using the jasperreports libraries.

## Rationale

## Usage

Either open the project in Intellij Idea or directly compile and run it with maven using the instructions provided in ``runme.bat`` file.

Copy config.properties.template to config.properties and fill it accordingly. You can use different config files by passing them as an option when running the program for example like ``mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="config1.properties"``
